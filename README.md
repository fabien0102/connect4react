It will be create following TDD process, using react tools.

## Connect 4 rules
The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves four discs in a row, diagonally, and wins. If the game board fills before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.

- board size: 7 columns x 6 rows
